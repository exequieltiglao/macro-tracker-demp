# Macro Tracker Demo

A hybrid mobile application for tracking macro intakes (calories, carbs, proteins, fats) with camera and barcode scanning capabilities.

## Features

- üì∏ **Camera Integration**: Take photos of food items for macro tracking
- üì± **Barcode Scanning**: Scan product barcodes to automatically get nutritional information
- üìä **Macro Tracking**: Track daily intake of calories, carbohydrates, proteins, and fats
- üìà **Visual Analytics**: View weekly calorie intake charts and progress
- üìù **Food History**: Keep track of all logged food entries with timestamps
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Profile Management**: Set personal goals and customize macro targets
- üîî **Notifications**: Get reminders and achievement notifications
- üíæ **Local Storage**: All data stored locally on device

## Screenshots

The app includes four main screens:
- **Home**: Daily macro overview with progress bars and weekly charts
- **Camera**: Photo capture and barcode scanning interface
- **History**: Past food entries organized by date
- **Profile**: User settings, goals, and preferences

## Key Features Implementation

### Camera Integration
- Uses `react-native-vision-camera` for high-performance camera access
- Supports both photo capture and barcode scanning modes
- Automatic permission handling

### Barcode Scanning
- Simulated barcode scanning (can be replaced with real barcode scanner)
- Product lookup with nutritional information
- Automatic macro calculation

### Macro Tracking
- Real-time macro calculation and storage
- Daily goal tracking with progress visualization
- Weekly analytics with charts

### Data Persistence
- All data stored locally using AsyncStorage
- Food history with timestamps
- User profile and goal settings
- Daily macro totals

## Customization

### Adding Real Barcode Scanning
Replace the simulated barcode scanning in `CameraScreen.js` with a real barcode scanner library like `react-native-barcode-scanner`.

### Food Recognition API
Integrate with food recognition APIs like:
- Google Vision API
- Clarifai Food API
- Microsoft Computer Vision API

### Nutritional Database
Connect to nutritional databases like:
- USDA Food Database
- Edamam Nutrition API
- Spoonacular API

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Real barcode scanning integration
- [ ] AI-powered food recognition
- [ ] Social features and sharing
- [ ] Meal planning and recipes
- [ ] Water intake tracking
- [ ] Exercise integration
- [ ] Cloud sync and backup
- [ ] Offline mode improvements
